# src/frontend/ui_components.py

# This file is included to demonstrate a potential separation of frontend
# concerns, even though for this specific Streamlit app, many UI components
# are directly called within the Streamlit page files (Home.py and pages/*.py).

# In a more complex application, or if you were building a custom UI layer
# separate from direct Streamlit calls, this file would contain functions
# that encapsulate reusable UI elements, layouts, or stylistic choices.

# Example (not used directly in current app structure but illustrates purpose):
# import streamlit as st
#
# def display_app_header(title: str, description: str):
#     """Displays the main header and description for a page."""
#     st.title(title)
#     st.markdown(description)
#
# def create_text_input(label: str, height: int = 150, placeholder: str = "", key: str = ""):
#     """Returns a Streamlit text area for user input."""
#     return st.text_area(label, height=height, placeholder=placeholder, key=key)

# For this project, specific UI elements are directly in Home.py and the pages.
# This file serves as a placeholder for future UI modularization if needed.
